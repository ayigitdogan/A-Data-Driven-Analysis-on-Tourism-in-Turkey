# A Data Driven Analysis on Tourism in Turkey

Being famous for a variety of historical sites and seaside resorts along its Aegean and Mediterranean Sea coasts, Turkey employs tourism as one of the major factors of its economy. Besides being one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world when it comes to beach holidays and natural/historical tours, healthcare-focused visits are also seeming to contribute to tourism activity in Turkey in recent years.

This data-driven work is dedicated to investigating insights on the number of visitors and tourism incomes of Turkey from 2009 to 2022 by taking the factors such as exchange rates and customer price indices into consideration.

The data used in the analysis are extracted from Electronic Data Delivery System, which is provided by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, and from Google Trends.
